  abstract    = {Quick system installation and recovery of university's computer centers has been issues of common concern to computer center's managers. Due to all causes such as the computer operating system's failures, crashes, data loss and other issues, we take the advantage of Intel PXE and ghost network multicast technology to implement the building and running the remote cloning system in LAN, greatly improving the efficiency of management and maintenance of the computer center and achieving a good result as we expected. This article describes the PXE, network multicast key technologies and working principles, and gives some methods and techniques summarized on the basis of Intel PXE-based remote cloning system, while the characteristics of the system are described.},

Briefly, a boot loader is the first software program that runs when a computer starts. It is responsible for loading and transferring control to the operating system kernel software (such as the Hurd or Linux). The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of the operating system (e.g. GNU).},
